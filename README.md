# Altra64-Redo
A attempt to remove problems with Altra64. not meant for users yet.

#Why
Altra64 has issues
  layers and layers of old code
  unneded dependancies
  uses typedefs from the 90s
  broken features
  others want to incorperate altra64 in their projects

#What hardware does this repo target
Daisy Drive 64 for now.
Unfortunately ED64P users need to wait. I plan to read non bad support later. This is the second step.

#Roadmap in no order
get it buildinng on dd64 -> complete
clean up images -> complete
fix save database problems
fix non booting roms
fix unnesacery dependanies
fix use of libultra types
clean up unused code

fix mp3 slowdown

list goes on
